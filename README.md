# Week 3 solo project "Mr. Robogers Neighbohood" 

#### _{Brief description of application}, {Date of current version}_

#### By Brian Sturgis


## Description


I have pasted from the project detail just to trap the information all in one place.

This project requires this application to take a number from a user and return a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:

- Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
- Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
- Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
- These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless - - the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished - program,

- The number 13 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neigh bor?"
- The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
- The number 32 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

- A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
